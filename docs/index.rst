aospy: automated climate data analysis and management
=====================================================
aospy is a Python-based tool for automating computations involving gridded climate data and the management of the results of those computations.

.. note::

  A major improvement in the documentation (as well as a major refactor of aospy's internals) is currently under way.

.. warning::
  aospy is being actively developed, and therefore the code base is pretty unstable, both the internals and user-facing components.  But we will do our best to avoid breaking backwards compatibility as much possible.

Troubleshooting
===============
Any questions are welcome and best placed as Issues on the `Github repo <https://github.com/spencerahill/aospy>`_.

Development
===========
aospy is currently developed by `Spencer Hill <https://github.com/spencerahill>`_ and `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.  We are actively seeking new users and/or contributors.  Please get in touch!
