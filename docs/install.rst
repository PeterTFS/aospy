Installation
============
Simply clone the main Github repo::

  git clone https://www.github.com/spencerahill/aospy/aospy.git
  cd aospy
  python setup.py install

Once we reach the v0.1 release, aospy will become available on PyPI (i.e. ``pip install aospy``) and conda (``conda install aospy``).  For now, just use the above ``git clone`` method.  Please open an issue if you have any installation problems.
