Introduction
============

aospy is a framework for automating the analysis of climate model output and the management of the resulting data.  This enables automated execution of an arbitrary number of calculations across an arbitrary number of models, simulations, time periods, and other parameter settings -- even if the internal variable names or other settings are not consistent across models or simulations.

Pending documentation upgrade
=============================

A major improvement in the documentation is currently under way.  In the meantime, please accept our apologies for the paucity of documentation!

And, if you aren't scared away yet, contact Spencer Hill, spencerahill@gmail.com, for more information.
